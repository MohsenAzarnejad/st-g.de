## Hot Topics

Currently, I'd be particularly happy to speak about the following topics:

- Jenkins Pipeline suite
- Continuous Delivery (of network infrastructure) 
- Software-defined networking using ONOS

## Jenkins Pipelines (Oct 2016)

Pipelines are a central element of Continuous Delivery and break the delivery process down into multiple stages. By visualizing the flow through the pipeline, the delivery team receives feedback about the status of a change made to the delivered software project.

The implementation of such pipelines using the popular Jenkins CI software has been pretty rough until the public release of a whole set of plugins earlier this year. These pipeline plugins are under very active development and now bring decent support for both pipeline visualization as well as configuration using an own domain specific language.

The talk will give an overview over Jenkins' new pipeline plugins, as well as different ways to define pipelines as code, i.e., manually, by scanning all repos of a Github organization, and via the shared library. 
By describing a setup for automated testing and releasing of Chef cookbooks, some of the features offered by Jenkins pipelines will be demonstrated.

## Let's go HTTPS-only! (May 2016)
 
We are really overdue with encrypting all the things! During this talk, I discussed that setting up HTTPS is more than just buying a
certificate - for the good and for the bad.
On the one hand, one doesn't even have to buy one, when [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) is an option. On the other hand,
there are bunch of options that should be undertaken to make the setup really secure. This includes HTTP Strict Transport Security headers,
correct ciphers, and many more.

## Using Gerrit Code Review in an Open-Source Project (Feb. 2013)

How the TYPO3 project ensures code quality through peer-reviews using "Gerrit Code Review"
This talk presents Gerrit itself and the workflow and lessons learned in a big, community-driven open-source project: the TYPO3 project.
Gerrit is used here for all top-level projects (TYPO3 CMS, TYPO3 Flow, TYPO3 Neos) since two years to handle every single code change.
In addition to human reviews, automatic tests in Jenkins and TravisCI are executed. Gerrit brings transparency into our community-driven
project and allows everybody to participate by pushing patches and voting for/against any change.
