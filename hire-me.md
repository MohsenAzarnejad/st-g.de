After finishing my PhD with a focus on software-based networks probably in March 2017, I am looking for a job in a team of talented peers.
I have broad experience in IT infrastructure maintenance as well as networking.

I'd either work **full remote** or - if we both share the luck to be situated in the same nice area - in reach of [**WÃ¼rzburg, Germany**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/W%C3%BCrzburg,+Germany/@49.778052,9.8729894,12z/data=!4m15!1m9!4m8!1m0!1m6!1m2!1s0x47a2902012da4dd9:0x41db728f06209a0!2sW%C3%BCrzburg,+Germany!2m2!1d9.9533548!2d49.7913044!3m4!1s0x47a2902012da4dd9:0x41db728f06209a0!8m2!3d49.7913044!4d9.9533548?hl=en-US):

Due to my widespread interests, I get easily fascinated by a wide variety of jobs. I can very well imagine to work in one of the following areas:

<span data-track-content data-content-name="Hire Me / Job Types" data-content-piece="Job Types"></span>

* infrastructure engineering / SRE at a large scale, preferably with Kubernetes and friends
* networking engineering / network programming at large scale using software defined networking
* product development related to software-based networks
* fostering a DevOps culture in your organization by inspiring people to talk and helping them to automate

_Please note:_ I don't want to be your one-man-show, i.e., being your sole infrastructure guy. I'd really like have a team, from which I can learn and discuss with. Peer review culture would receive extra bonus.
