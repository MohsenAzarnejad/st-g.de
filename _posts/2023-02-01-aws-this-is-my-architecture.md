[This is My Architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/this-is-my-architecture) is a video series produced by AWS, where customers are presenting interesting architectures through short video clips.

I had the pleasure and honor to present emnify's packet gateway architecture in such a video. You can see the result here:

Thanks to amazing our account manager, the AWS TMA team, as well as Amazon's video crew came over to Munich to record ca. 20 customer videos.
